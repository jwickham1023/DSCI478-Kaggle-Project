# DSCI478 Kaggle Project - Credit Card Fraud Detection

In 2024 alone, 134 million Americans have been victims of credit card fraud, with unauthorized purchases accounting for 6.2 billion dollars annually. This trend of fraud is on the rise in financial and business challenges. (Reference 1).  While consumers are generally protected from fraudulent transactions, the impact is beyond the negative experience; financial institutions and businesses bear the cost.

To reduce these risks, financial institutions leverage Machine Learning (ML) and other statistical models to detect and prevent transactions from occurring. Creating effective fraud detection models has challenges, including correctly classifying fraudulent transactions, minimizing customer impact with false positives, and dealing with multiple fraud vectors.

In this project, we will explore the process of creating a fraud detection model, the data set we used, feature engineering, model evaluation metrics, and the challenges of imbalanced data sets. Since fraudulent activity is rare, accuracy metrics are not applicable when determining model evaluation as they mainly give a score on how well it detects *non-fraud*. In this project we will be using precision, recall, F1 score and the Precision-Recall Curve (PR - AUC) to provide an accurate representation of the model given the challenges in the data set.
