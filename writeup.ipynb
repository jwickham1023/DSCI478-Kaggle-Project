    "In 2024 alone, 134 million Americans have been victims of credit card fraud, with unauthorized purchases accounting for 6.2 billion dollars annually. This trend of fraud is on the rise in financial and business challenges. (Reference 1).  While consumers are generally protected from fraudulent transactions, the impact is beyond the negative experience; financial institutions and businesses bear the cost.\n",

Creating effective fraud detection models has challenges, including correctly classifying fraudulent transactions, minimizing customer impact with false positives, and dealing with multiple fraud vectors.\n",

    "In this project, we will explore the process of creating a fraud detection model, the data set we used, feature engineering, model evaluation metrics, and the challenges of imbalanced data sets. Since fraudulent activity is rare, accuracy metrics are not applicable when determining model evaluation as they only give a score on how well it detects *non-fraud*. In this project we will be using precision, recall, F1 score and the Precision-Recall Curve (PR - AUC) to provide an accurate representation of the model given the challenges in the data set"

    "Since this data was synthetically generated, no missing (NaN) values were present. In the data, the `TX_FRAUD_SCENARIO` column was dropped to prevent data leakage as it contained information directly to the fraud classification. `TX_DATETIME` was transformed into multiple features--`TX_HOUR` (hour of the transaction) and `TX_DAYOFWEEK` (day of the transaction week)--to capture temporal patterns. Once that transformation was completed, `TX_DATETIME` was dropped due to redundant data.\n",

    "Completing these preprocessing steps ensure that the dataset was structured for feature extraction while also minimizing data leakage. Transforming `TX_DATETIME` allowed us to capture temporal fraud patterns. With these preprocessing steps done, the data set is now ready for exploratory data analysis (EDA), where we will be determining patterns in fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions, key trends and assess potential predictive features."

    "Initially we performed basic data exploration to learn more about our data set. One of the first things in our exploration analysis that was noticeable was that the data set was highly imbalanced, with only fraudulent activity making up a small proportion of the total (which was a given considering we're working with fraud). Being aware of class balance is important as it affects model performance and evaluation metrics. Additionally, we analyzed the average transaction that customers typically make with their cards. With this information we wanted to determine if going above or below the average transaction was more likely fraudulent. Since this was a significant factor in fraud detection, we further explored whether a customer’s personal average carried more of a determining factor than global average (See Figure 1)."

    "To create a robust fraud detection, we engineered features that capture both population fraud trends and individual customer-based spending behaviors. This creates a model that can detect a wide range of fraud tactics while also identifying personalized anomalies that could indicate fraudulent activity at a customer level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transaction amount serves as a critical indication in fraudulent activity. We applied a Z-score normalization to standardize transactions relative to the dataset mean, which ensures that large transaction values were flagged as unusual. However, some of the fraudulent activities attempted to fall within the customer expected ranges but still would appear abnormal compared to overall transaction patterns. Since specific terminals were exploited, we implemented rolling seven-and twenty-eight day rolling fraud rates. Acknowledging that a terminal who has had fraudulent activity doesn’t mean they will always be fraudulent we implemented an exponential decay factor to ensure old occurrences of fraud had a diminishing influence in our model and attempting to prevent model but still capturing consistent fraud risk. To further improve our population fraud trend, we implemented a Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and an unsupervised anomaly detection method that assigned a likelihood of fraud score based on its behavior. This method creates context-based detecting and maintains to not solely rely on extreme transaction values. During the feature engineering process we considered using an Isolation Forest for our unsupervised choice, but the anomaly score made our model rely on the Isolation Forest prediction, which reduced its ability to learn other fraudulent trends.\n",

    "The population-based trend provides a big picture view of our sample, but fraudulent transactions often are different from customer behavior rather than population norm. To recognize this, we engineered features that will adapt to each customer's unique spending habits instead of over relying on dataset wide fraud indicators. The key feature of detecting fraud at a customer level is track spending behavior over time. We computed a 14-day rolling window that tracks whether a customer suddenly makes a significant change in their spending habits. This can help with identifying fraud scenarios where fraudsters make large transactions over a short period, deviation from previous spending habits. We normalized the transaction amount based on each customer's historical data instead of the entire data set. This implementation prevents the model from flagging frequently high spending larger transactions, while still detecting unexpected large purchases from lower spending customers.\n",
